## Kanban Board with JavaScript.
## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a simple Kanban board using vanilla JavaScript, without relying on any frameworks. A Kanban board is a visual project management tool used to organize tasks and track progress through different stages of a workflow. It typically consists of columns representing various stages of work (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Done") and cards representing individual tasks. Users can add, edit, and move cards between columns, providing a flexible and intuitive way to manage projects and tasks.
